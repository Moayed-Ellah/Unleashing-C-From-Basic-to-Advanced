<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>This comprehensive C++ course is designed to provide a solid foundation in the C++ programming language. It covers all of the essential C++ topics, including basic syntax, data types, control flow, functions, classes and objects, and templates. The course also delves into more advanced concepts such as memory management, exception handling, and advanced template techniques.</p>



<h2 id="instructor-information">Instructor Information</h2>

<p>The instructor is a software developer and a student at a community college. He have worked on projects for over six years, including system software, website development, and AI applications. He is passionate about learning and sharing his knowledge with other students.</p>



<h2 id="course-scope">Course Scope</h2>

<p>In this course, we will begin by introducing you to the C++ development environment and the basic syntax of the language. As we progress, you will learn about variables and data types, control flow and looping constructs, functions and arrays, and pointers. We will then delve into object-oriented programming in C++ and cover topics such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading. You will also learn about templates, the Standard Template Library (STL), input/output, file processing, and exception handling. Additionally, we will cover some of the new features and improvements such as automatic type inference, lambda functions, move semantics, and the Concurrency and Parallelism library.</p>



<h2 id="course-format">Course Format</h2>

<p>This course is offered online and self-paced. Each lesson is approximately 1 hour in length, and the course will take approximately 25 hours to complete. You can take the course at your own pace and complete it on your own schedule.</p>



<h2 id="course-schedule">Course Schedule</h2>

<p>The course is available for enrollment at any time. Each lesson will be released weekly, and there will be a deadline for each assignment and project. The deadlines for each assignment will be provided in the course.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>To make the most out of this course, you should have a basic understanding of programming concepts, and a good understanding of computers and operating systems. Additionally, you should be familiar with text editors and have a strong desire to learn and grow as a C++ developer.</p>



<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Understand the basics of C++ programming, including data types, control flow, and functions</li>

  <li>Write, test, and debug C++ programs using an integrated development environment</li>

  <li>Implement object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism</li>

  <li>Use templates and the Standard Template Library (STL) to write generic, reusable code</li>
