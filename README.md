<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>This comprehensive C++ course is designed to provide a solid foundation in the C++ programming language. It covers all of the essential C++ topics, including basic syntax, data types, control flow, functions, classes and objects, and templates. The course also delves into more advanced concepts such as memory management, exception handling, and advanced template techniques.</p>



<h2 id="instructor-information">Instructor Information</h2>

<p>I am a software developer and a student at a community college. I have worked on projects for over six years, including system software, website development, and AI applications. I am passionate about learning and sharing my knowledge with other students. I am excited to do this through this course.</p>



<h2 id="course-scope">Course Scope</h2>

<p>In this course, we will begin by introducing you to the C++ development environment and the basic syntax of the language. As we progress, you will learn about variables and data types, control flow and looping constructs, functions and arrays, and pointers. We will then delve into object-oriented programming in C++ and cover topics such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading. You will also learn about templates, the Standard Template Library (STL), input/output, file processing, and exception handling. Additionally, we will cover some of the new features and improvements such as automatic type inference, lambda functions, move semantics, and the Concurrency and Parallelism library.</p>
